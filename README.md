# Task 5: Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Tree & Random Forest

## 🔍 Objective
To implement classification on the Heart Disease dataset using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, and evaluate performance and feature importance.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter (Google Colab)

## 📂 Files
- `heart.csv` - Dataset used for training/testing.
- `decision_tree_random_forest.ipynb` - Code implementation for the task.
- `screenshots/tree_visualization.png` - Visualization of the decision tree.

## ✅ Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Loaded the heart disease dataset, split into features and target.

2. **Trained Decision Tree**  
   Visualized the tree and evaluated overfitting by controlling tree depth.

3. **Trained Random Forest**  
   Compared accuracy and extracted feature importances.

4. **Cross-Validation**  
   Used 5-fold cross-validation for both models.
